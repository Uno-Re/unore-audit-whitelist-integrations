# IA Whitelist Integrations
This list is maintained by the InsuredAudit team to to notify protocols which have forked / cherrypicked features from the whitelisted protocols, in case there is an exploit happening with the core contracts of the main underlying protocol.

Additionally any protocol covered by Uno Re under the Insured Audit B2B insurance policy agreement can integrate with any of the protocols in the list and be covered by default unless significant changes have been made on top of the forked codebase.
